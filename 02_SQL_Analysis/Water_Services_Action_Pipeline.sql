-- ðŸ’§ WATER ACCESS ANALYTICS â€“ IMPROVEMENT & ACTION PIPELINE
-- Author: Olise Ebinum
-- Database: md_water_services
-- Description:
--   This SQL project identifies underserved communities by analyzing
--   water source types, pollution levels, and queue times. It integrates
--   multiple datasets â€” visits, locations, and pollution results â€” into
--   actionable insights and infrastructure improvement recommendations.
--
-- Skills Demonstrated:
--   âœ… Multi-table joins and conditional filtering
--   âœ… CTE and VIEW creation for modular analysis
--   âœ… Case logic for decision-driven improvements
--   âœ… Population distribution and percentage breakdowns
--   âœ… Project tracking via progress tables
