# 💧 Water Access Analytics  

An **end-to-end data analytics project** exploring water access, distribution, and infrastructure performance using **SQL** and **Power BI**.  
This project demonstrates how raw data can be transformed into actionable insights that support data-driven decision-making for sustainable resource management.  

---

## 📘 Overview  

**Water_Access_Analytics** showcases a complete analytics workflow — from **data collection and preprocessing** to **SQL analysis** and **Power BI visualization**.  
The goal is to identify disparities in water access, understand infrastructure reliability, and communicate insights through interactive dashboards.  

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies  

- **SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL)** — Data extraction, cleaning, and aggregation  
- **Power BI** — Dashboard creation and data storytelling  
- **Excel / CSV** — Data import and transformation  
- **Python (optional)** — For additional data preprocessing  
- **Git & GitHub** — Version control and collaboration  

---

## 📂 Repository Structure  

This repository is organized into three main stages reflecting the project workflow:  

- **01_data_collection_preprocessing/** — Raw data integration, schema design, and data cleaning scripts  
- **02_sql_analysis/** — SQL scripts for aggregation, ranking, and exploratory analysis  
- **03_powerbi_visualization/** — Power BI dashboard files and exported reports  
- **/screenshots/** — Visuals from the interactive dashboard  
- **README.md** — Documentation outlining objectives, methodology, and insights

## 🚀 Project Workflow  

| Phase | Description | Key Outputs |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| **Part 1 – Data Collection & Preprocessing** | Combined multi-source data (surveys, visits, employee records) into a unified relational structure. Cleaned and validated inconsistencies using SQL. | Cleaned, normalized dataset |
| **Part 2 – SQL Analysis** | Explored distribution of water sources, analyzed population served, and identified underserved areas using aggregation and ranking queries. | SQL insights and data summaries |
| **Part 3 – Power BI Visualization** | Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard highlighting water access gaps, queue times, and repair priorities. | Interactive dashboard & visuals |

## 🌍 Project Preview  

> _Below are key visuals from the Power BI dashboard illustrating data-driven insights on water access and infrastructure performance._

| Visualization | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **🌐 Water Source Map** | Displays geographic distribution of water sources across provinces, with color-coded functionality rates. |
| **📊 Source Type Comparison** | Bar chart comparing wells, shared taps, and in-home taps by accessibility and performance. |
| **⏳ Queue Time Analysis** | Visualizes average water collection time across towns, highlighting critical delays. |
| **👥 Population Impact Dashboard** | KPI cards and filters showing total population served and areas most affected by non-functional water sources. |

📸 *You can add screenshots or exported dashboard images inside the `/screenshots/` folder once ready.*

## 📊 Key Insights  

- Over **60% of water sources** are located in **rural areas**, where demand exceeds capacity.  
- **Shared taps** serve ~2,000 people on average and are often nonfunctional.  
- **Wells (18%)** are essential but only **28%** provide clean, safe water.  
- Repair priorities should target **high-population, long-queue regions** for maximum impact.  

---

## 🧩 Learning Outcomes  

- Designed a **scalable data pipeline** integrating SQL and Power BI.  
- Strengthened proficiency in **SQL joins, window functions, and data validation**.  
- Enhanced ability to **translate data into visual narratives** through dashboards.  
- Demonstrated how analytics can inform **sustainable infrastructure decisions**.
